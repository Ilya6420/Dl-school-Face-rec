For the normal execution of the .ipynb notebook, you need two datasets (there are links to them in the laptop)

P.s I wanted to run the notebook from beginning to end, with the results of the cells, but alas, there is not enough RAM.
Therefore, if you want to see the results, then you need to run all the cells by yourself.
